        <hr>
        <p class="lead" align="justify">In today's digital age, effective communication and collaboration are essential for students' academic and social growth. An online dedicated discussion blog titled as “Connect and Converse”  will serve as an effective platform for university students to share ideas, ask questions, and engage them in meaningful conversations / discussions on various topics. This project aims to develop a web-based interactive discussion hub (blog) for university students using PHP and any suitable framework to ensure a strong and user-friendly experience. The proposed project will develop comprehensive web development skills, enhance user experience design, and foster online community engagement for students working on it. It will also encourage student interaction, support knowledge sharing, and build a friendly online community among university students as its users.</p>
